## Introduction

Monero is a private, secure, untraceable currency. You are your bank, you control your funds, and nobody can trace your transfers.

**Privacy:** Monero uses a cryptographically sound system to allow you to send and receive funds without your transactions being easily revealed on the blockchain (the ledger of transactions that everyone has). This ensures that your purchases, receipts, and all transfers remain absolutely private by default.

**Security:** Using the power of a distributed peer-to-peer consensus network, every transaction on the network is cryptographically secured. Individual wallets have a 24 word mnemonic that is only displayed once, and can be written down to backup the wallet. Wallet files are encrypted with a passphrase to ensure they are useless if stolen.

**Untraceability:** By taking advantage of ring signatures, a special property of certain types of cryptography, Monero is able to ensure that transactions are not only untraceable, but have an optional measure of ambiguity that ensures that transactions cannot easily be tied back to an individual user or computer.

## About this Project

This is the core implementation of Monero. It is open source and completely free to use without restrictions, except for those specified in the license agreement below. There are no restrictions on anyone creating an alternative implementation of Monero that uses the protocol and network in a compatible manner.

As with many development projects, the repository on Github is considered to be the "staging" area for the latest changes. Before changes are merged into that branch on the main repository, they are tested by individual developers, committed to the "development" branch, and then subsequently tested by contributors who focus on thorough testing and code reviews. That having been said, the repository should be carefully considered before using it in a production environment, unless there is a patch in the repository for a particular show-stopping issue you are experiencing. It is generally a better idea to use a tagged release for stability.

Anyone is able to contribute to Monero. If you have a fix or code change, feel free to submit is as a pull request directly to the "development" branch. In cases where the change is relatively small or does not affect other parts of the codebase it may be merged in immediately by any one of the collaborators. On the other hand, if the change is particularly large or complex, it is expected that it will be discussed at length either well in advance of the pull request being submitted, or even directly on the pull request.

## Compiling Monero

### On Unix and Linux:

Dependencies: GCC 4.7.3 or later, CMake 2.8.6 or later, libunbound 1.4.16 or later (note: Unbound is not a dependency, libunbound is), and Boost 1.53 or later (except 1.54, [more details here](http://goo.gl/RrCFmA)).
Static Build Additional Dependencies: ldns 1.6.17 or later, expat 1.1 or later, bison or yacc

**Basic Process:**

* To build, change to the root of the source code directory, and run `make`.
* The resulting executables can be found in `build/release/src` or `build/debug/src`, depending on what you're building.

**Advanced options:**

* Parallel build: run `make -j<number of threads>` instead of `make`.
* Statically linked release build: run `make release-static`.
* Debug build: run `make build-debug`.
* Test suite: run `make test-release` to run tests in addition to building. Running `make test-debug` will do the same to the debug version.
* Building with Clang: it may be possible to use Clang instead of GCC, but this may not work everywhere. To build, run `export CC=clang CXX=clang++` before running `make`.

### On OS X:

The project can be built from scratch by following instructions for Unix and Linux above.

Alternatively, it can be built in an easier and more automated fashion using Homebrew:

* Ensure Homebrew is installed, it can be found at http://brew.sh
* Add the repository to brew: `brew tap sammy007/cryptonight`
* Build Monero: `brew install --HEAD bitmonero`

### On Windows:

Dependencies: mingw-w64, msys2, CMake 2.8.6 or later, libunbound 1.4.16 or later (note: Unbound is not a dependency, libunbound is), and Boost 1.53 or 1.55 (except 1.54, [more details here](http://goo.gl/RrCFmA)).
Static Build Additional Dependencies: ldns 1.6.17 or later, expat 1.1 or later

**Preparing the Build Environment**

* Download the [MSYS2 installer](http://msys2.github.io), 64-bit or 32-bit as needed, and run it.
* Use the shortcut associated with your architecture to launch the MSYS2 environment. On 64-bit systems that would be the MinGW-w64 Win64 Shell shortcut. Note that if you are running 64-bit Windows, you will have both 64-bit and 32-bit environments.
* Update the packages in your MSYS2 install:
```
pacman -Sy
pacman -Su --ignoregroup base
pacman -Su
```
* For those of you already familiar with pacman, you can run the normal `pacman -Syu` to update, but you may get errors and need to restart MSYS2 if pacman's dependencies are updated.
* Install dependencies: `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc make mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-unbound mingw-w64-x86_64-boost`
* If you are planning to build statically you will also need to install: `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-ldns mingw-w64-x86_64-expat` (note that these are likely already installed by the unbound dependency installation above)

**Building**

* From the root of the source code directory run:
```
mkdir build
cd build
```
* If you are on a 64-bit system, run:
```
cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/64-bit-toolchain.cmake -D MSYS2_FOLDER=c:/msys64 ..
```
* If you are on a 32-bit system, run:
```
cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/32-bit-toolchain.cmake -D MSYS2_FOLDER=c:/msys32 ..
```
* You can now run `make` to have it build
* The resulting executables can be found in `build/release/src` or `build/debug/src`, depending on what you're building.

If you installed MSYS2 in a folder other than c:/msys64, make the appropriate substitution above.

**Advanced options:**

* Parallel build: run `make -j<number of threads>` instead of `make`.
* Statically linked release build: run `make release-static`.
* Debug build: run `make build-debug`.
* Test suite: run `make test-release` to run tests in addition to building. Running `make test-debug` will do the same to the debug version.

### On FreeBSD:

The project can be built from scratch by following instructions for Unix and Linux above.

We expect to add Monero into the ports tree in the near future, which will aid in managing installations using ports or packages.

## Building Documentation

Monero developer documentation uses Doxygen, and is currently a work-in-progress.

Dependencies: Doxygen 1.8.0 or later, Graphviz 2.28 or later (optional).

* To build, change to the root of the source code directory, and run `doxygen Doxyfile`
* If you have installed Graphviz, you can also generate in-doc diagrams by instead running `HAVE_DOT=YES doxygen Doxyfile`
* The output will be built in doc/html/
